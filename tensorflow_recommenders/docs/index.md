# TensorFlow Recommenders

TensorFlow Recommenders is a library for building recommender system models
using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org).

It helps with the full workflow of building a recommender system: data
preparation, model formulation, training, evaluation, and deployment.

It's built on Keras and aims to have a gentle learning curve while still giving
you the flexibility to build complex models.
